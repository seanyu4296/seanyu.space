Hey there ðŸ‘‹, just a guy giving learning a public a shot.

I am currently helping [Xendit](https://www.xendit.co/en/) scale its Payment infrastructure across Asia by solving tech problems and prevent problems from happening. My work revolves around **building and maintaining systems that scale from domain discovery to execution, exploring new tech, and coaching others**.

<!-- reviewing tech specs, exploring new tech, maintaining internal libs and coaching other engineers. -->

<!-- I love to make sure i and my colleagues write software together that meets feature requirements and deadlines, but also built to last, easy to evolve to, and hard to break. -->
I love learning new paradigms that may improve or challenge previous ones. I have a wide array of interests that I garnered along the way that ranges from **Functional Programming, Front end Development and now mainly dabbling in Distributed Systems, Observability, Backend Development in general and solving org-wide engineering problems**.

Previously, I worked at [Zap](https://www.zapestore.com/) and some other side projects w/ friends (2017-2020), where I kicked off my software engineering career out from business school. After stitching together a very crude web app myself for a small business with my friends, I realised I wanted to give software engineering a try. Since then, I have not looked back. In Zap, I **lead the front end team to build web apps, mobile apps, serverless applications (mostly in AWS), and use** [Purescript](https://github.com/zapph/purescript-jason), a strongly-typed functional programming language in production.

### Outside of work

You will find me in the [parks of HongKong trying out new calisthenic moves](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17946957623160711/), wandering around the city and trails with my wife or at home noodling with my guitar and reading some non-fiction books.
