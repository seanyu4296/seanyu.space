TLDR; Here is my [CV](./Sean%20Tristan%20Yu%20CV.pdf).

Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Sean hereâ€”engineer, builder, and relentless learner.

Currently, I lead [Xendit](https://www.xendit.co/en/)'s Payments team, where Iâ€™m responsible for scaling payment infrastructure across Asia and solving some of the hardest technical and team challenges. Iâ€™m passionate about making impact through both system improvements and by empowering those around me.

I thrive on learning new paradigms and experimenting with functional programming, distributed systems, observability, and cloud infrastructure.

Career-wise, I started out by building my first web app for a small business back in college, which sparked my jump from business grad to software engineer.

Whether itâ€™s shipping new products, creating dashboards that uncover cost savings, architecting for scale, or coaching teams through chaos, I bring curiosity, structure, and a people-first mindset. Iâ€™m most energized when collaborating to turn technical challenges into meaningful impact.


### Outside of work

You will find me learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, doing some Calisthenics, playing in a Church worship band, and wandering the city and trails with my wife.
