TLDR; Here is my [CV](./Sean%20Tristan%20Yu%20CV.pdf).

Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Sean here, a guy giving learning a public a shot.

I am currently helping [Xendit](https://www.xendit.co/en/) scale its Payment infrastructure across Asia by solving tech problems and preventing problems from happening. My work revolves around **building and maintaining systems, exploring new tech, and coaching others**.

<!-- reviewing tech specs, exploring new tech, maintaining internal libs and coaching other engineers. -->

<!-- I love to make sure i and my colleagues write software together that meets feature requirements and deadlines, but also built to last, easy to evolve to, and hard to break. -->
I love learning new paradigms that improve or challenge previous ones. I have a wide array of interests that I garnered along the way - these range from **Functional Programming to Front end Development**. Now, I mainly dabble in Distributed Systems, Observability, Backend Development, and solving org-wide engineering problems.

Just some history, my career started when I stitched up a very crude web app for a small business back in college. I realised I wanted to give software engineering a try and I have not looked back since. After graduation, I worked at [Zap](https://www.zapestore.com/) where I **led the front end team to utilize [Purescript](https://github.com/zapph/purescript-jason) and React** to build web apps, mobile apps, and serverless applications in production.

### Outside of work

You will find me [trying out new calisthenic moves in the parks of Hong Kong](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17946957623160711/), wandering the city and trails with my wife, or noodling with my guitar at home.
